/**
 * Rewrites plugin metadata in the WP admin so the customer sees the
 * operator's brand instead of the upstream package's.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * Whitelabel branding is in every Manage GPL plan, in ManageWP as a
 * paid add-on, and in Zeebrar's "coming soon" list. For DeckWP it
 * sits in FREE / PRO / AGENCY all three — without it, the FREE tier
 * isn't vendable. The dashboard collects the operator's branding
 * config (plugin renames, hide-from-list, custom URLs) and pushes
 * it to the connector via {@see WhitelabelRoute}.
 *
 * ## What this class does
 *
 * Hooks into `all_plugins` (the array WP populates the admin
 * Plugins page from) at priority 9999 — after every other filter,
 * so the rewrites stick on the rendered output. For each entry in
 * the dashboard-pushed config we:
 *
 *   - Override `Name` / `Title`
 *   - Override `Description`
 *   - Override `Author` / `AuthorName` / `AuthorURI`
 *   - Override `PluginURI` (the "Visit plugin site" link target)
 *   - Drop the entry entirely if `hide: true` — the row simply
 *     doesn't render. The plugin is still loaded by WP; only the
 *     UI presence is suppressed.
 *
 * `filterAllPlugins` runs in two passes (v0.25.0+):
 *
 *   1. Exact-path matches. Iterates every plugin on disk and
 *      applies overrides whose key matches the entry's path
 *      verbatim. Handles the canonical case where the customer's
 *      WP install layout matches what the dashboard expects.
 *
 *   2. Connector-identity-by-basename. If a rebrand was configured
 *      for `deckwp-connect/deckwp-connect.php` (the canonical
 *      connector path), Pass 2 also applies it to ANY other plugin
 *      on disk whose basename is `deckwp-connect.php`. This
 *      survives the "duplicate folder install" scenario where a
 *      stale copy of the connector lives at e.g.
 *      `deckwp-connect-main/deckwp-connect.php` from a manual ZIP
 *      upload that wasn't cleaned up — the operator's rebrand
 *      sticks on every copy regardless of folder name.
 *
 * Plus agency-level toggles (v0.21.0+) — boolean switches that
 * apply globally, not per-plugin. Currently shipped:
 *
 *   - `hide_updates` (v0.21.0) — strip the connector's OWN row
 *     from the update_plugins transient so customer wp-admin
 *     doesn't surface an "Update available" notice for the
 *     rebranded plugin. Distinct from {@see UpdateSuppressor}
 *     which gates the dashboard's managed-slugs list.
 *
 *   - `suppress_activate` (v0.22.0) — hide the inline
 *     "Plugin activated." / "Plugin deactivated." notice WP
 *     renders on `plugins.php` after a state-change action. The
 *     notice is rendered inline by core (not via `admin_notices`)
 *     so we can't unhook it — we inject scoped CSS on the
 *     plugins.php screen to hide it. The plugin's actual
 *     activation isn't affected, only the leak-y confirmation
 *     banner.
 *
 *   - `help_links` (v0.22.0) — strip URL-bearing items from the
 *     plugin row meta (View details, Visit plugin site, Author
 *     site) across ALL plugin rows. If `help_links_url` is set,
 *     append a single "Support" anchor pointing at it. Version +
 *     "By Author" text items are preserved (no URL leak).
 *
 *   - `custom_login` (v0.23.0) — replace the wp-login.php logo
 *     image + accent color via inline CSS on the
 *     `login_enqueue_scripts` action. Also retargets the logo's
 *     anchor URL + title attribute so the hover/click no longer
 *     advertises WordPress. Color falls back gracefully when no
 *     valid hex is provided; logo URL falls back to the default
 *     WP logo when empty (only the URL retarget applies, keeping
 *     this fully opt-in granular).
 *
 *   - `adminbar_logo` (v0.23.0) — unhook the entire `wp-logo`
 *     adminbar node (including its About / Documentation /
 *     Support sub-menu) so customer-facing adminbars don't leak
 *     WP identity. If `adminbar_logo_url` is set, drop in a
 *     replacement node `deckwp-whitelabel-logo` with the custom
 *     image as its icon (rendered via CSS background-image).
 *
 * ## What this class does NOT do
 *
 * - Theme rebrand. Reserved for v2 (the option storage already
 *   carries a `themes` key for forward-compat). Themes have a
 *   different filter surface (`wp_get_theme`, `themes_api_result`)
 *   and the operator demand for theme rebrand is lower than plugin
 *   rebrand on competitive parity grounds.
 * - Hide from the network plugins page when the connector is
 *   network-active without per-blog overrides. Storage is one
 *   network-wide config; per-blog whitelabel is a wire-shape
 *   extension if ever needed (out of scope for MVP).
 * - Suppress the plugin's own "View details" thickbox in a
 *   targeted way (we strip all URL-bearing meta when
 *   `help_links` is on, but we don't selectively hide individual
 *   meta items by their text — too brittle across locales).
 *
 * ## Storage
 *
 * `deckwp_whitelabel_config` site option (network-wide on multisite,
 * equivalent to wp_options on single-site). Empty / missing option
 * makes every filter a no-op — the class is safe to register before
 * any config has arrived from the dashboard.
 *
 * ## Honesty about limits of metadata rewriting
 *
 * Rewriting `Name` here is cosmetic — WP plugin update checks still
 * use the original slug to talk to wp.org or the UltraPack catalog.
 * A customer who Googles the rebranded name will land on DeckWP's
 * marketing pages (good); a customer who reads the source files in
 * `wp-content/plugins/` will see the original branding (acceptable
 * — the goal is a polished admin UI, not source-level deception).

     *      behavior — works for every rebrand scenario where the
     *      operator's WP-on-disk path matches what the dashboard
     *      thinks it is.
     *
     *   2. Connector-identity-by-basename. Some operators end up with
     *      a non-canonical copy of the connector on disk (typical:
     *      they uploaded `deckwp-connect-main.zip` from GitHub's
     *      source archive without renaming, and the canonical
     *      `deckwp-connect/` got installed alongside via Auto-pair).
     *      Both copies report `Plugin Name: DeckWP Connect` in their
     *      header and both render in plugins.php — but the dashboard
     *      only knows the canonical path, so without this pass the
     *      stale copy leaks the upstream brand even when the rebrand
     *      is configured.
     *
     *      Pass 2 takes the override entry that was sent for
     *      `deckwp-connect/deckwp-connect.php` (if any) and ALSO
     *      applies it to any other plugin on disk whose basename is
     *      `deckwp-connect.php`. False-positive risk is essentially
     *      zero — no third party ships a plugin file named
     *      `deckwp-connect.php`.

     *      Pass 2 skips entries that already had their own override

     *      rebranded by the operator don't get double-rewritten).

     * file. Same root cause as the
     * "name in the heartbeat payload is wrong" symptom that was
     * reported in operator testing.
     *
     * ## Why gettext
     *
     * `_get_plugin_data_markup_translate()` runs `translate()` over
     * the Name / Description / Author / *URI fields when assembling
     * the plugin-data array. `translate()` fires the `gettext`
     * filter. So intercepting `gettext` for `$domain ===
     * 'deckwp-connect'` catches every consumer of get_plugins()
     * indirectly — no need to hook each WP surface individually.
     *
     * ## Scope
     *
     * Strictly self-scoped to the connector's own textdomain. Other
     * plugins' `__()`/`_e()` calls go through untouched even when
     * the source text happens to match — we check the `$domain`
     * argument first.
     *
     * @param  string  $translation  The translated text (or original if not translated).
     * @param  string  $text         The original source string.
     * @param  string  $domain       Text domain. We only act on 'deckwp-connect'.

     * Two independent override knobs:

     *     image. We hard-code dimensions (84x84) matching WP's
     *     default logo block so the layout doesn't shift. Custom
     *     logos at other aspect ratios may overflow; the box is
     *     `background-size: contain` so non-square images letterbox.
     *
     *   - `custom_login_color` — applies a tint to the primary
     *     button + the focus accent on the login form input
     *     borders. Validated as a CSS hex color (3 / 4 / 6 / 8 hex
     *     digits) at render time — non-hex values are skipped
     *     entirely rather than emitted as garbage that could break
     *     the page.
     *
     * Self-gates on the toggle being ON. When ON but both URL +
     * color empty, the method early-returns (no CSS to emit) — the
     * toggle alone, without any value, is a no-op. The
     * `login_headerurl` / `login_headertext` filters below ARE
     * applied even with empty URL + color, because their fallback
